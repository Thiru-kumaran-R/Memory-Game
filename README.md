# Single Player Memory Game

## Introduction

The Single Player Memory Game is a fun and engaging way to test and improve your memory skills. In this game, you'll flip over cards to find matching pairs, trying to remember the locations of previously revealed cards. The goal is to match all the pairs in the least number of moves possible.

## How to Play

### Objective
The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards with the fewest moves.

### Setup
1. **Grid Layout:**
   - The game board consists of a grid of face-down cards. The number of cards and the grid size can vary, but a common setup is a 4x4 grid with 16 cards (8 pairs).

### Instructions
1. **Starting the Game:**
   - At the beginning of the game, all cards are laid out face down in a grid.
   
2. **Flipping Cards:**
   - Click on any card to flip it over and reveal its image or value.
   - Click on a second card to flip it over.
   
3. **Checking for a Match:**
   - If the two flipped cards have the same image or value, they remain face up.
   - If the two flipped cards do not match, they are flipped back face down after a short delay, allowing you to try and remember their positions.
   
4. **Continue Playing:**
   - Continue flipping two cards at a time, using your memory to try to find pairs that match.
   
5. **Game Over:**
   - The game is over when all pairs have been found and all cards are face up.
